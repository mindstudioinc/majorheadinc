  <h1>404.</h1>
  <p>Whatever you were looking for, it isn't here. :(</p>
  <h2>Why you're here, <where>and where to go</where>.</h2>
  <p>If you meant to go look for our works, <a href="/work/index.htm">there's a section for that right here.</a></p>
  <p>If you <em>WANTED</em> to see this 404 page, you found it. Congratulations.</p>
  <p>Maybe you're looking for the old <em>Devils</em> comics! Is this true? Click the blue: <a href="https://alephd.neocities.org/devils/"><blue>blue</blue></a></p>
  <p>If there was a page here, it has been deleted, or something must have happened on either Neocities or our end.</p>
  <p><a href="/index.html">If none of these reasons apply to you, go to the home page, located at the root of this site</a>.
